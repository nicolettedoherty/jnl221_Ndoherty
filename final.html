			<h3>Books Banned Behind Bars</h3>
			<p> The censorship of books has been in the headlines of many news stories across the country but this issue runs deeper than just education systems. In recent years, books have been being banned or restricted throughout United States prisons at a more rapid rate than in the past. <br>

<br>States can individually determine which books they allow in their prisons which has sparked questions across the country. <i>What makes a book bannable? Why are they being banned?</i> <br>

<br>Two states, Connecticut and Texas, have taken different approaches to this ongoing issue. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCVM1gcNoXq0DM9dsT-VyXX3ZSe7AGKZFrAZhKJAeoA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Data research</a> has shown that in 2021 alone, Texas banned six times more books than Connecticut; Texas banned 616 books  in 2021 and Connecticut banned 109 books. Some of these restrictions consist of similar reasonings or books, however there have been other shocking findings. 
 </p>
			<h3>Books Banned in Texas Prisons</h3>
<p>In September, 2021 there were 84 books banned in Texas prisons. This was the highest amount of books banned in the entire year. The main reason that these books were banned was because they contained sexually explicit images. Even if one page contains this content, they considered the book to be banned or restricted. However, this was also the main reason that books were banned in Texas prisons throughout the entire year. Out of 616 books that were banned in Texas during 2021, 320 of them were banned because of this reason; this is a little more than half of the books. <br>

<p>
<br>Books were banned more frequently due to the inclusion of sexual content versus violence, criminal activity, fighting techniques, or even weapon construction. This exemplifies the arbitrary and obscure standards that these prisons follow for censorship. In April, Texas banned the book “Beekeeping for Dummies” by Howland Blackiston as well as the book “Mixed Martial Arts Handbook” by John Ritschel yet failed to ban some of the most outright and well-known problematic texts. <br>

<br>Texas inmates have access to Hitler's manifesto, "Mein Kampf", yet the state outlawed Ida B. Wells' groundbreaking book "On Lynchings" because it discussed racial vigilante mobs and contained "racial slurs." States have their own jurisdiction over censorship of these texts which may reflect political stances, religious beliefs, etc.

<h3>Books Banned in Connecticut Prisons</h3>

<div>
   <img src="Jan-2.jpg"alt="Graph showing which month the most books were banned in Connecticut in 2021" height="500px" width="600px"> 
  </div>

<p>In March, 2021 there were 25 books banned in Connecticut prisons. This was the greatest amount of books banned within the entire year. Every book banned in March, 2021 in Connecticut was due to explicit nudity. This is similar to Texas which mainly banned books because of the inclusion of sexually explicit content. Although Connecticut is a smaller state than Texas, with smaller correctional facilities and a smaller amount of incarcerated individuals, they follow some of the same guidelines regarding censorship. <br>

<br>It is interesting that the most were banned in March, but it is unclear if this is due to the types of prisoners in the Connecticut prisons at this time, an outside determining factor or if it is unrelated. <br>


<br>The main reason for books being banned in Connecticut prisons in 2021 was due to the inclusion of pictorially explicit nudity which was the same as March alone. The second highest reason for banning books in these prisons was due to them containing written sexually explicit behavior. It is interesting that the main concern for texts in prisons is them encouraging sexual behavior or actions rather than violence, hate speech, criminal activity, or even escape methods. <br>

<br>Six different authors had two or more books banned in Connecticut in the year 2021. One of these authors was Claire Thompson who has published 85 novels since 1996 which fall into the BDSM genre. Three of her novels were banned in the year 2021 alone within CT prisons due to their inclusion of sexually explicit material. Authors John Fleske and Love Belvin also had two books banned each due to similar reasons. <br>

<br>Unlike Texas, “Mein Kampf”, Hitler’s Manifesto is banned in Connecticut prisons. But it is accompanied by novels such as Ke$ha’s autobiography, graphic novels, and evidently many erotica novels.

<h3>Reasoning Behind Banning These Books</h3>
<p>A law professor at the University of California Irvine, <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/reiter/" target="_blank"> Keramet Reiter</a>, had her own book banned in various prisons throughout the United States. Reiter’s novel, “23/7: Pelican Bay Prison and The Rise of Long Term Solitary Confinement”, discusses the inhumane practices within U.S. prison systems and the history of the institutions themselves. <br>

<br>“The idea that a book from a top university press about the history of prisons would be banned is surprising,” Reiter said. “What is so disturbing about the history of these institutions that the people running them feel like it can’t be told?” <br>

<br>Reiter emphasized that the logic behind these censorship is severely flawed and problematic. <br>

<br>“I have heard of very few book bans that actually seemed logical at any point in history,” said Reiter. <br>

<br>It is unclear why prisons are banning books more frequently in recent years however it is most likely associated with political and religious beliefs or opinions. This can be seen with the difference of censorship amongst a historically blue state, Connecticut, and a historically red state, Texas. <br>

<br>Journalist for <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-new-york-florida-censorship" target="_blank">The Marshall Project</a>, Keri Blakinger, has done extensive research of her own regarding this issue. Blakinger found that prison systems where lots of books are banned are not generally safer or less chaotic than those that don’t ban many titles. <br>

<br>This issue will continue to be relevant throughout the country and subsequently will spark conversations, questions and debates for years to come. <br>

			<h3>Consequences of Banning Books in Prisons</h3>
			<p>	Professor at Syracuse Univerity’s School of Arts and Sciences, Dr. Rae Ann Meriwether, has done personal research on the topic of banned books throughout the United States. She emphasized the importance of reading books even while incarcerated which is only one of the concepts that sparks debates in our country. <br>

<br>“Book banning feels to me like a huge potential assault on our democracy,” said Meriwether. <br>

<br>Censorship within our country has overtaken our prison systems and more recently our education systems but is disregarding some of the fundamental rights our country was established on. <br>

<br>Meriwether said, “You have imprisoned people, maybe wanting to read, wanting to educate themselves about other lives, other existences, other things and then they are being denied this whole world of imagination or even real life stories that they could learn from. They’re being denied certain types of knowledge which is crushing.” <br>

<br>Meriwether believes that by stripping prisoners of these resources, we are doing them and in return our country a disadvantage. It is difficult to maintain civil liberties or even re-enter society following a prison sentence with a lack of awareness and knowledge. <br>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>	Overall, the similarities amongst the books banned or restricted in Connecticut and Texas prisons consist of the types of texts being censored most often. In both of these states, books including sexually explicit content or nudity were banned most frequently. <br>

<br>Although there were discrepancies between some more controversial texts being banned in specific states, this will remain to be an ongoing issue in our country. <br>

<br>Censorship has been heightened in recent years and continues to headline media, spark debates, and raise questions; whether it is in education or even prison systems. <br>
